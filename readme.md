# Movie Plot Generator

I created this repository to generate creative movie plot ideas using advanced data-driven approaches. Whether youâ€™re a screenwriter looking for inspiration or a data enthusiast exploring natural language generation, this project provides a unique tool for crafting story concepts.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Plot Generation**: Leverages state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for creative writing.
- **Customizable Inputs**: Modify genres, themes, or keywords to generate tailored plots.
- **Interactive Notebook**: Step-by-step structure for exploring and understanding the generation process.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Key dependencies:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow` or `pytorch` (depending on implementation)
  - `matplotlib` (optional, for visualizations)

Install all dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohit-Kundu/Movie_Plot_Generator.git
   cd Movie_Plot_Generator
   ```
2. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Movie_plot_generation.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to input parameters and generate unique movie plots.

## Examples
- **Generated Plot Example 1**:  
  A reclusive scientist accidentally creates a sentient AI that dreams of becoming human, leading to an existential showdown.
  
- **Generated Plot Example 2**:  
  In a dystopian world where memories are commodities, a smuggler discovers a conspiracy that threatens the fabric of reality.
